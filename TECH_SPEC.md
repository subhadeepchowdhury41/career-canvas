%% Assumptions, architecture, schema, and test plan. DON’T Write this with AI.

I used Antigravity to design and develop this project.

I used the following frameworks and tools:

- React for the frontend
- Vite for the frontend build tool
- Express for the backend
- TypeScript for the backend
- PostgreSQL for the database
- Drizzle ORM for the database

It is written in Serverless architecture.
